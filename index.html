		<h2>A sceries of Unfortunate events</h2>


<p>He was a monster.</p>
<p>He was the product of man's greed, man's arrogance, man's envy. He was the monster that  parents warned their children about, the monster that was never blessed with a simply hello, or a simply goodbye.</p>
<p>And like how the day changed faces, his walks down the streets of London seemed never ending, neither pleasent or peaceful as he gazed into the beautiful moonlight lit sky.</p>
<p>When was the last time his soul shone like the morning sun and the towns people welcomed him with open arms? </p>
<p> Nobody would want to love a monster such as himself.</p>
<p>Oh, how quick they have forgotten</p>
<p>How quick, they are to ridicule, the monster the've created</p>
<p>the Monster once was just like you and me, he walked side by side with the working class, he was once a working member of society.</p>
<p>Just like you and me.</p>
